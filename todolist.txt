Improvements:
Dynamic maker page wine list
Redesign UI to match C7
Integrate iFrameResizer.js to fix in-C7 presentation

Bugs:
"Save as PDF" cuts pages weird
Divs don't size correctly on chrome

Urgent:
REMOVE CANVAS FROM canvas_shell -- resize the two in tandem, rather than childing the canvas to it

Improvements:
Dynamic maker page wine list
Redesign UI to match C7
Integrate iFrameResizer.js to fix in-C7 presentation

Bugs:
"Save as PDF" cuts pages weird
Divs don't size correctly on chrome
NOT FOUND being prepended inaccurately

Urgent:
REMOVE CANVAS FROM canvas_shell -- resize the two in tandem, rather than childing the canvas to it

consider moving from p5pdf.js to jsPDF (pathway for single pages is save canvas as image, load as p5image, make b&w, save as pdf, for full catalog is save canvas as image, save image as pdf)
add checkbox option for wines only (on all edit checks, if toggle is On it won't allow if label includes "InsertedCopy". Will turn off all such rows when toggled on.)
